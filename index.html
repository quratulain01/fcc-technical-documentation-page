            <header id="heading">Getting started with HTML</header>
            <p>In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements,
                attributes,
                and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML.
                You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other
                important basic
                language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!</p>

            <header id="heading">What is HTML</header>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a <em>markup language</em> that
                tells web
                browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
                developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark
                up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make
                content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider
                the following line of text:</p>

            <table class="table1">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>My cat is very grumpy</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a
                paragraph <code>(<span><<span>p</span>></span>)</code> element:</p>

            <table class="table1">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <span>
                                &lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
                            </span>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <div class="notecard">
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>
                    Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For
                    example:
                    <span>
                        &lt;title&gt;
                    </span>
                    tag could be written as
                    <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code>, or
                    <code>&lt;tiTLE&gt;</code>
                    etc, and it will work.
                    However, it is best practice to write all tags
                    in lowercase for consistency and readability.

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_HTML_element">
            <header id="heading">Anatomy of HTML element</header>
            <p>Let's further explore the paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
            <p>
                <img alt
                    src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png">
            </p>

            <p>The anatomy of our element is:
            <ul class="lists">
                <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists the name of the element (in this example, <em>p</em>
                    for paragraph, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. The opening tag marks where the
                    element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph
                    text.</li>
                <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the
                    paragraph text.</li>
                <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes the
                    forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include the
                    closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
            </ul>
            The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by closing tag.

                <a href="#nesting_elements" title="Permalink to Nesting elements">Nesting elements</a>
            </h3>

            <p>
                Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called <em>nesting</em>. If we want to state that
                our cat is <stron>very</strong> grumpy, we would wrap the word <em>very</em> in a &lt;strong&gt;
                    element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
            </p>

            <table class="table1">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <span>
                                &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
                            </span>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then
                opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing
                the p.

                The following is an example of the <em>wrong</em> way to do nesting:
            </p>
            <table class="table1">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <span>
                                &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
                            </span>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                The <strong>tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another.</strong>
                With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of
                guessing can result in unexpected results.

                    inline elements</a>
            </h3>

            <p>
                There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline
                elements.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line
                    following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears
                    on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a
                    block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A
                    block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside
                    another block-level element.Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level
                    element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a
                    block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements
                    on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists,
                    navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but
                    it might be nested inside another block-level element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the
                    document’s content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause
                    a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an &lt;a&gt;
                    element
                    creates a hyperlink, and elements such as &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; create emphasis
                </li>
            </ul>

                <a href="#empty_elements" title="Permalink to Empty elements">Empty elements</a>
            </h3>

            <p>
                Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist
                of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For example, the
                &lt;img&gt; element embeds an image file onto a page. Empty elements are sometimes called <em>void
                    elemnts.</em>
            </p>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header id="heading">Attributes</header>

            <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>

            <img id="attr-img"
                src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png">

            <div>
                Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this
                example, the <strong style="background-color: lightgray;">class</strong> attribute is an identifying
                name used to target the element with style information
            </div>

            <div>
                An attribute should have:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the
                        attributes should be separated by spaces too.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </h3>

            <div>
                Another example of an element is <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;a&gt;</span>. This
                stands for <em>anchor.</em> An anchor can make the text it encloses
                into a hyperlink. Anchors can take a number of attributes, but several are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong style="background-color: lightgray;">href</strong>: This attribute's value specifies the
                        web address for the link. For example: <span
                            style="background-color: lightgray;">href="https://www.mozilla.org/"</span>.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong style="background-color: lightgray;">title</strong>: The <span
                            style="background-color: lightgray;">title</span> attribute specifies extra information
                        about the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to. For example,
                        <span style="background-color: lightgray;">title="The Mozilla homepage"</span>. This appears as
                        a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong style="background-color: lightgray;">target</strong>: The <span
                            style="background-color: lightgray;">target</span> attribute specifies the browsing context
                        used to display the link. For example, <span
                            style="background-color: lightgray;">target="_blank"</span> will display the link in a new
                        tab. If
                        you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <a href="#boolean_attributes" title="Permalink to Boolean Attributes">Boolean attributes</a>
            </h3>

            <p>
                Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called
                Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the
                attribute name. For example, consider the disabled attribute, which you can assign to form input
                elements. (You use this to disable the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The disabled
                elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.) For example:
            </p>

            <div class="bgcolored">
                &lt;input type="text" disabled="disabled"&gt;

            <p>
                If you look at code for a lot of other sites, you might come across a number of strange markup styles,
                including attribute values without quotes. This is permitted in certain circumstances, but it can also
                break your markup in other circumstances. Always include the attribute quotes. It avoids such problems,
                and results in more readable code.

            </h3>

            <p>
                In this article you will also notice that the attributes are wrapped in double quotes. However, you
                might see single quotes in some HTML code. This is a matter of style. You can feel free to choose which
                one you prefer. However, make sure you don't mix single quotes and double quotes. If you use one type of
                quote, you can use the other type of quote <em>inside</em> your attribute values. To use quote marks
                inside other quote marks of the same type (single or double quote), use <span style="font:bold">HTML
                    entities</span>.

                Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements
                combine to form an entire HTML page:
            </p>


            <div class="bgcolored">
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
                &lt;html&gt;<br>
                &emsp; &lt;head&gt;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp; &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; <br>
                &emsp;&emsp; &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt; <br>
                &emsp; &lt;/head&gt;<br>
                &emsp; &lt;body&gt;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp; &lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                &emsp; &lt;/body&gt;<br>
                &lt;/html&gt;<br>
            </div>

            <div>
                Here we have
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>: The doctype. When HTML
                        was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page
                        had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look something different, but more
                        recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to
                        work right. <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> is the
                        shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span>: This element wraps
                        all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>: This element acts
                        as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, <span
                            style="font: bold">that isn't the content</span> the page will show to viewers. This
                        includes keywords and a page description that would appear in
                        search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more
                        about this in the next article of the series.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span>: This element
                        specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the
                        vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual
                        content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some
                        problems later.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span>: This sets the
                        title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The
                        page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span>: This contains all
                        the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio
                        tracks, or whatever else.
                    </li>

            <header id="heading">Including special characters in HTML</header>
            <div>
                In HTML, the characters <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;</span>, <span
                    style="background-color: lightgray;">&gt;</span>, <span
                    style="background-color: lightgray;">&quot;</span>, <span
                    style="background-color: lightgray;">&apos;</span> and <span
                    style="background-color: lightgray;">&amp;</span> are special characters. hey are parts of the HTML
                syntax itself. So how do you include one of these special characters in your text? For example, if you
                want to use an ampersand or less-than sign, and not have it interpreted as code.<br>
                You do this with character references. These are special codes that represent characters, to be used in
                these exact circumstances. Each character reference starts with an ampersand (&amp;), and ends with a
                semicolon (&semi;).

        <section class="main-section" id="HTML_comments">
            <header id="heading">HTML comments</header>

            <div>
                HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making
                comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to
                explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long
                enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are
                making changes and updates.

                To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers
                <span style="background-color: lightgray;">&lt;&excl;&dash;&dash;</span> and <span
                    style="background-color: lightgray;">&dash;&dash;&gt;</span>

                You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour of the basics of HTML.

                At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it works at a basic level. You should
                also be able to write a few elements and attributes. The subsequent articles of this module go further
                on some of the topics introduced here, as well as presenting other concepts of the language.
